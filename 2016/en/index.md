    SnowCamp only in Grenoble

#The [CFP](https://cfp.snowcamp.io) est open until the 25th of December. Time to write your proposals.

#### A local event
Yes, SnowCamp is unique and in Grenoble, it will drive you [NUTS](http://www.grenoble-tourisme.com/en/discover/gastronomy/local-specialties-and-products/).

#### Snow 
    SnowCamp will be held on a Thursday and a Friday so we can go skiing/snowboarding/sledging on the Saturday.

#### Innovation
    To avoid being just another conference (even with snow) SnowCamp is an opinionated conference.
    With lightning talks from PhD students and researchers thus mixing developpers with another branch of the geek society.
    Technical only.
