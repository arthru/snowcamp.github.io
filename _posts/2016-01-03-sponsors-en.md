#Become a SnowCamp Sponsor!

    SnowCamp is an event that gathers 250 developers on innovation and development (Web, Mobile, Java, Cloud, IoT…) for a 2-days conference on the 21st and 22nd of January in Grenoble (French Alps), followed by an skiing "unconference" on the 23rd.

This technical conference targets developers and researchers, mixing them to foster innovation.
The keynote will feature lightning talks (5 minutes) where researchers and PhD students will present their research topics.

Since the early stage of electricity, Grenoble has been a place of
innovation: laboratories and industries at the forefront of technology have
established themselves there, it was ranked \#5 most innovative city in the
world by Forbes magazine and it is now labelled “French Tech” as a
recognition of its technical leadership in France. In Grenoble, innovation
dug its roots in the surrounding mountains. That’s why the SnowCamp
team organizes an *"unconference"* day following the conference where
attendees will keep on sharing their knowledge and ideas in a less formal
and more relax context, prone to creativity : the snowy slopes.

Why should you sponsor SnowCamp? You need to recruit new talents,
you want to set up or confirm your image in innovating communities, or
spread the developers about your services and products; then the
SnowCamp is the perfect opportunity!
To make possible those 2 days of conferences and workshops (with 3
parallel tracks, cumulating more than 30 presentations) with a very
attractive price of 50 euros, your support is highly welcome.

All you need to do is to say “yes” to one of the sponsoring packs we’re
proposing.

Note that the number of partnerships will be limited.
